Oh no! The forces of justice are selflessly doing good again! It is up to you to figure out where they could be. Your intelligence agents have gathered the following data:
	- a list of where the heroes may be at t=0
	- the heroes do not make u-turns
	- the heroes do not stop in traffic
	- a city map
	- there are no one-way streets
	- at each integer t, the heroes are at an intersection
	- the heroes can only go up to one road per time unit
	- the list will not have duplicate entries
	- numbering is from 0
	- heroes are allowed to retire (for example if they cannot find anything else to do)
There are V intersections, E1 roads, and E2 non-busy intersections.
Let E=E1+E2
Let N be the number of intersections the heroes could be at at t=0
Let M be the number of intersections the heroes could be at after T time units
(V+E)*T≤9000²+1
Time limit: about a second (for all except #20)? sure, why not… (see later)
Input:
V E N T
{E1 lines of x y, where the road joins the intersections x and y, 0≤x,y<V}
{E2 lines of x x, where intersection x is not busy}
{N integers x, separated by spaces, which are the intersections the heroes could be at at t=0}
Output:
V M {M integers x, separated by spaces, which are the intersections the heroes could be at at t=T}
Time:
On a decent computer, you should get around 10 seconds for all the test cases, and about a second for #20.
On a bad computer, you should get about 1 second average for #3 through #19, and about 5 seconds for #20.
