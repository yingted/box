Given two integers m, n, calculate the product mn and output it on a single line (to save file space for test cases).
m has M digits and n has N digits. There may be leading zeroes in the input, but not in the output.
M+N<=100000 for 20% of test cases. M+N<=1000000 always. This takes 1.5 seconds on my computer.
Input:
M N
{M lines, each with one digit of m}
{N lines, each with one digit of n}
Output:
m*n
Sample input:

Sample output:
156
Explanation: 12*13=156
