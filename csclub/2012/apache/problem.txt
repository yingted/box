You have been hired to work as a server. A /web/ server!
Unfortunately, because you don't have the latest hardware, you are very slow.
To augment this, you have found some servers in other countries to serve requests.
They can serve exactly one client at a time.
In particular, servers cannot handle multiple clients in the same time unit.
Users should be preferentially served by servers from the same country.
You accidentally forgot to leave out some entries in the server logs: the responses!
You have to forge the server logs. Server logs are written sequentially, which
means the entries are sorted earliest to latest. The transcript should be complete
(i.e. include all entries, even those after the last input entry).
Country names and paths do not contain spaces. Times and delays are numerical.
The earliest ready server serves the client if there is a discrepancy. Forged logs
always come after non-forged logs.
Times have no leading zeroes.
Warning: inputs 14-20 are large
Log entries (these form a single complete transcript):
1. single server installation (these are available)
	{time} up {country} {delay}
	1347651000000 up Canada 50
2. single client connection (these are available)
	{time} get {country} {path}
	1347651000001 get Mars /index.html
	1347651000001 get Canada /index.html
3. single request failed (these need to be forged)
	{time} 503 {client-country} {path}
	1347651000001 503 Canada /index.html
4. single request served (these need to be forged)
	{time} 200 {client-country} {path}
	1347651000051 200 Mars /index.html
Explanation:
Right after the server was installed, two users connected from Mars and Canada respectively.
The first user was served by the server in Canada. The second user could not connect.
Input:
1347651000000 get Canada /index.html
1347651000000 up Canada 200
1347651000000 up Canada 50
1347651001000 get Canada /index.html?1
1347651001000 get Iraq /favicon.ico
1347651001050 get Canada /robots.txt
1347651001100 get Canada /robots.txt
Output:
1347651000000 get Canada /index.html
1347651000000 up Canada 200
1347651000000 up Canada 50
1347651001000 get Canada /index.html?1
1347651001000 get Iraq /favicon.ico
1347651001050 get Canada /robots.txt
1347651001050 200 Iraq /favicon.ico
1347651001050 503 Canada /robots.txt
1347651001100 get Canada /robots.txt
1347651001150 200 Canada /robots.txt
1347651001200 200 Canada /index.html?1
Explanation:
No server can respond to the first client.
The slow server responds to the second client at the end.
THe fast server responds to the third client at 1347651001050,
but cannot serve anyone else in that millisecond. The log is appended after
the fourth client's request.
The fourth client connects to the fast server and is given an error. This is logged.
Later, another request gets to the fast server.
The fast server serves the request. The slow server still isn't done.
