Hairy Harry gets a haircut. He has infinitely many hairs on an infinite lattice, one per point.
Given the coordinates of the region, how many hairs does he cut? Border hairs are cut based on the angle (i.e. a right angle is a quarter of a hair).
Inputs are given like in the problem graphics.
Assume hairs are infinitely thin cylinders of unit height, and amount of hair cut is by mass.
The areas are less than 2^62.
N, the number of points, is positive.
Input:
N
{N lines of x y}
Output:
hairs (single number on a single line)
Sample input:
3
0 0
0 1
1 0
Sample output:
0.5
Explanation:
90/360+45/360+45/360=0.5
