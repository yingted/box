You are programming in a language without mutable strings.
You have to create a long string by joining strings using +.
The run time of a+b is the length of the resultant string.
What is the fastest way to join your strings?
There are 10 inputs, and n is limited to 1000 on each
Input:
n s[0] s[1] â€¦ s[n-2] s[n-1]
{9 lines like the one above}
Output:
{minimum run time, one per line=10 lines}
Time: a minute for n=1000, a second for n<301
