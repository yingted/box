After collecting a lot of candy this Halloween, the most obvious next step is to organize it into piles and draw graphs of the loot. Of course.

The input file DATA1.txt will contain 5 lines, each a single positive integer describing the height of candy piles.

The output file OUT1.txt will contain an ASCII drawing of the piles of candy. A triangle of asterics will approximate such piles. Refer to the sample below.
