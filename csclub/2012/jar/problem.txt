You are working as a packager for object-oriented code in some language.
An object-oriented program is composed of classes, each of which depend on other classes.
Your job is to package each of N classes in to at most one "jar" (archive file).
Classes are public if they have a download page on your website.
On each download page, there will be a series of links of jars (archives) with a positive number of classes in each.
You must minimize the number of classes downloaded (i.e. it must be possible to download any set of public classes with minimal total classes downloaded) without including a class in multiple files.
Less importantly, you must minimize the number of archives.
There will be no more than 20 public classes.
There will be no more than 1000 classes.
Example:
1. (p)ublic class Game needs Physics
2. (p)ublic class Calculator needs Math
3. pri(v)ate class Physics needs Math
4. pri(v)ate class Math
5. pri(v)ate class Homework needs Math
jar 1: Game Physics
jar 2: Calculator
jar 3: Math
Input:
N
{number of requirements} {requirements}
{N-1 more lines}
Sample input:
5
p 1 3
p 1 4
v 1 4
v 0
v 1 4
Sample output:
3
