You are designing a machine that completes multiple choice tests. You know the answers and want to see the shortest distance to complete the test.
All the bubbles are infinitely small and on a 1 cm grid. Output the distance in cm.
Due to a limitation of the testing card technology, there is a strict limit of 50 questions per side (0<N≤50).
Input:
{N characters, each is A, B, C, D, or E}
{repeats until -}
Output:
{distance in cm, rounded to 4 significant places}
Sample input:
AEA
-
Sample output:
6.1231
Explanation:
A _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ E
A _ _ _ _
Re-order: A1, A3, E2
Time:
Times are given for Python reference solution and include interpreter startup time.
small test case takes 10 to 65 seconds using the slowest solution
medium test case takes 6 to 35 seconds using the second-slowest solution
large test case takes 5 to 30 seconds using the intended solution
xlarge test case takes 55 or more seconds using the intended solution
Greedy algorithm:
The naïve approximation algorithm should get more than 1, but less than half right on each test case.
