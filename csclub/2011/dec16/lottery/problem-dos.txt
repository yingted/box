Your class has decided to assign its N students N jobs. To do this, the teacher uses a grid with M rows and N columns to randomize the assignment of the students.
The teacher puts the students 1 to N on the top and the jobs 1 to N on the bottom. Then, the students are allowed to draw lines in the columns. No two lines can be horizontally adjacent.
To find the pairings, the teacher follows the line from each student down to a job, following a horizontal line whenever possible.
You want to make one student 0<S<=N have a specific job 0<J<=N. Output the minimum number of lines you need to add, or -1 if its not possible.
Input:
M N S J
{M rows of 2*N-1 characters}
{repeats until M=0}
