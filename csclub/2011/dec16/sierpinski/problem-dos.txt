Alice and Bob are playing a game online. They have M ducks and N geese. They take turns saying any permutation of "duck" and "goose" without repeating and whoever can't say another permutation loses. Unfortunately, they are both cheating by using a computer to keep track of the unused permutation. For example: (N=M=1)
Alice: duck goose
Bob: goose duck
Alice: I lose

Input:
M N where M+N<2^31
{repeats until M=N=0}
Sample input:
1 1
0 0
Sample output:
Bob wins

Marking scheme:
Perfect: 100 pts
99950/100000 or more: 20 pts
