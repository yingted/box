You are lost in a 2D underground colony.
Due to the uselessness of vertical tunnels, all tunnels slant up at 60°.
As a result, the map is a hexagonal grid of points:
- The row lengths alternate between X (with a leading space) and X+1 for some X
- The rows do not have trailing spaces
- The number of points in each row alternates between X and X+1 for some X
- The characters in each row alternates between spaces and points (non-spaces)
- There are monsters, represented by the symbol @.
You want to know where the monsters are at so you can avoid them.
You have a map of all N levels.
You have explored a region of M levels and want to know where you could be.
1≤N,M≤200 and no input line contains more than 255 characters.
There are no more than 100 test cases.
Each of these are reduced by 90% to 10% for the small test case.
The format for the region is the same as for the map.
Output (see explanation) the possible points from highest to lowest level.
If there is a tie, output lower points first.
Input:
N M
{N lines, successive rows of the map}
{M lines, successive explored rows}
{repeat until N=M=0}
Output:
{K, the number of possible points for this input}
level L point P
{L=-1 for the first row, L=-2 for the second, etc.}
{P=1 for the first point in the row, P=2 for the second, etc.}
{repeat for each point}
{repeat for each input}

Sample output:

level -2 point 6
Explanation:
The 1 means there is 1 point to follow for this input.
The region is located at the bottom-right-most place in the map.
The first shared level is -2, and the first shared point in level -2 is point 6.
The 0 0 ends the input.
