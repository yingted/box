You are practicing your swordsmanship.
You realize that the value of a special move is directly proportional to its length L.
Moves are defined to continue as long as they doesn't deviate more than Â½D from the intended trajectory.
However, this definition makes it hard to record motion data:
How can you know the intended trajectory until after the data is recorded?
To optimize the value of your special moves, you want to run a simulation on motion data.
You have lots of motion data with estimated deviations.
Calculate the length of a longest contiguous slice with a range of values spanning at most D.
Input:
N D
{N lines, 1 estimated displacement each}
Output:
L
Sample input:
10 5
-1000
0
1000
1002
1000
1001
999
998
456
-1000
Sample output:
6
Explanation:
There are 6 values ranging from 998 to 1002.
The difference of 4 is not greater than 5.
