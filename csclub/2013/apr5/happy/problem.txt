Generational Happiness  ###POINTS: 100###

  Each generation has a value of happiness among it's people. This
  happpiness can be the result of many events. Most of these events
  affect more then one generation, and all events give a different value
  of happiness.

  Time Limit: 5 Seconds per test case. 25 seconds In total per file.

Input:
  User will input x y z defining x amount of generations followed by y
  lines. Each following line will be in the format a b v where 0 < a <=
  b <= x and the range [a,b] is the range of generations affected by v
  value of happiness where -1000 <= v <= 1000. 0 < x < 10000000 , 0  <
  y < 100000. There will be 5 inputs in a row without spaces.
  Note: be efficient in the way you store happiness. Traditional methods
  might not be fast enough. And slow code makes me sad :(

Output:
  output the amount of happiness in the zth generation.
