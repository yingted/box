You are using a program called XL, which allows you to save columns in files.
Columns are numbered sequentially A, B, C, … Y, Z, AA, AB, … AZ, BA, … BZ, … CZ, … DZ, … YZ, … ZZ, AAA, ….
In other words the last letter that can be advanced (i.e. it isn't Z) is advanced and all the letters after it become A.
If all the letters are Z, instead of advancing a letter, an A is inserted at the start.
You have several files and you want to merge them by placing the columns next to each other.
Input:
a single line of the last column's labels, separated by spaces
Output:
the label of the last column of the merged file
Sample input:
AA M M
Sample output:
BA
Explanation:
AA is right after Z, so it is column 27. M is column 13. BA is 26 columns later than AA.
