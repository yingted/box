A flood has filled your R>0 rows by C>0 columns home!
The insurance company wants blueprints, which are blue and white.
Unfortunately, your blueprint is wrong, since it depicts your house.
In order to make it show the flooded state, you use the flood-fill tool.
The end result can be an entirely blue or entirely white blueprint.
You want to know M, the minimum number of steps if you can fill from any pixels.
You heard that one way to solve this problem is to try filling solely from each pixel.
Then, the answer is the minimum number of steps you took.
Input:
R C
{R rows of C columns each containing 'b' or 'w'}
{repeats until R=C=0}
Output:
{1 line per test case containing M, the minimum number of steps}
Sample input:
2 2
bw
wb
5 3
bbw
wwb
bbb
www
bbb
0 0
Sample output:
2
2
Explanation:
Start with the top-right white pixel.
Start with the block of 4 blue pixels.
Time:
R,C≤15 for small
R,C≤50 for large (extra credit, worth half of small)
